# Oop is a proggramming paradim that allows programs to be structured in form of objects that contain 
# contain attributes and behaviour.

# Define a class
# Then create an instance of that objecting that present class.
# The process of creating an objecting is called instantiation.
# Ideally each instance of a days should have unique attributes.
# For a class to accept instance variables we add___init____ method/fuction to the class.
